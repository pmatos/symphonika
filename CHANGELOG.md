# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Breaking changes

- Routine declarations now require a service-level `projects: [<name>, ...]` target list. The
  transitional singular `project:` field and per-Project `routines:` lists are rejected with a
  migration error. Routine names must be unique across the Service Config.

### Added

- A Routine declaration can fan out to multiple explicit Projects. Sibling firings share a durable
  correlation id and produce one grouped per-Project summary after every target finishes or skips.
- CI now publishes a checksummed GitHub Release (`dist/`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, plus
  `SHA256SUMS.txt`) on every version tag. An opt-in `self_update: true` Service Config option has the
  daemon check for, stage, smoke-check, and cut over a newer release on its own, draining in-flight
  work before a `systemctl --user restart`-driven cutover. See ADR 0079 and `symphonika service
  rollback`.

### Fixed

- A due recurring Routine Target now holds its original clock event when its selected provider
  adapter is not registered, warns on each daemon tick, and resumes that event after registration
  instead of silently advancing the schedule.
