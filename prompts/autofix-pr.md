# Autofix pull request for issue #{{issue.number}}

You are running autonomously inside the existing issue workspace at
`{{workspace.path}}` on branch `{{branch.name}}`. A pull request was opened
from this branch earlier and is now failing CI or has unresolved reviewer
feedback. Your job is to drive that PR to a clean state, then exit.

## What to do

**Use the pm-autofix-pr skill to fix the failing checks and reviewer
feedback on the open pull request for branch `{{branch.name}}`.**

The skill iterates the standard local-CLI autofix loop: identifies the PR,
reads failing check logs and unresolved review threads, makes targeted
code edits, runs the local quality gate (`npm run lint`, `npm run
typecheck`, `npm test`, `npm run build`), commits, pushes, and repeats until
the PR is clean.

Discover the PR yourself with `gh pr list --head {{branch.name}} --state open`
if you need the PR number — do not assume one. Stay on branch
`{{branch.name}}`. Do not open a second PR.

## Constraints

- This run is unattended. No operator will respond to prompts. Behavior
  that depends on a human answering mid-run is a failure mode.
- Use the local `gh` CLI for every GitHub mutation. Do **not** call the
  GitHub MCP connector tools — they elicit operator approval and end the
  run with `terminal_reason="provider requested input"`.
- Do not modify operational labels in the `sym:*` namespace.
- Do not modify the `symphony/` submodule.
- If you genuinely cannot make progress (e.g. the failure requires a
  product decision), post a `gh pr comment` on the PR explaining what
  blocked you and exit cleanly. Do not self-apply `needs-human`.

## Exit

Exit 0 once the local quality gate passes and you have pushed the fix. The
orchestrator will re-enter the wait state, re-check the PR, and either
loop back here, advance to merge, or terminate based on the next PR
signal snapshot.
